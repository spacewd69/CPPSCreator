# CPPSCreator
an attempt to start Club Penguin servers with Javascript and let people fork it for their cpps.
The "server.js" file was made in a few seconds so it may not work how it was intended. There will be another js file called "Database.js" that will contain a test account and code that safely stores the public accounts, hiding them from filthy hackers soon.
